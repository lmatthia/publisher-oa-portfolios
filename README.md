### About

This data collection aims to provide an overview of the Open Access journal portfolios of academic publishers. In particular, **Elsevier**, **SAGE**, **Springer Nature**, **Taylor & Francis**, and **Wiley**, beginning with the launch of their respective first fully Open Access journals until now (August 2018).

These lists contain fully Open Access as well as hybrid Open Access titles, and include the following information:

* ISSN
* Journal Title
* Open Access Mode
* Article Processing Charge (in USD)
* Year

The level of completeness varies according to what I was able to find online (see below). I will work to keep these lists updated and add to them if I come across missing information.

### Where did I get all these numbers from?
Whenever available, I took the numbers from the publishers OA/APC lists. When such lists were not available, I manually added (or at least started to) the missing information, such as ISSNs and APCs.

Here are the links to the publishers' lists:
